# PlantGrowth Dataset

- **Variables**:
  - **weight**: Numeric variable representing the weight of the plants (in grams).
  - **group**: Factor variable indicating the treatment group to which the plant belongs. It has three levels:
    - `ctrl`: Control group
    - `trt1`: Treatment 1
    - `trt2`: Treatment 2

## Content

- The dataset contains measurements of plant weights that have been subjected to different growth treatments. The goal is often to compare the effects of these treatments on plant growth.

## Size

- The dataset typically consists of **30 observations** (plants), with **10 plants** in each treatment group.

## Purpose

- Used for analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine if there are statistically significant differences in plant weights between the treatment groups.

## Example Use

- You can use this dataset to perform ANOVA, visualize the weight distribution among groups, and draw conclusions about the effects of the treatments.

This dataset is useful for educational purposes in statistics and data analysis.
